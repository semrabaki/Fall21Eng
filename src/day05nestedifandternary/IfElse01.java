 	Type java code by using if-else if() statement.
	Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
	If the year is divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 400. ==> 1600 is leap, but 1700 is not
	If a year is not divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 4. ==> 2004 is leap year, but 2007 is not

 		  "&&" does not check the second condition if the first condition is false.
 		  "&" checks both conditions every time.
