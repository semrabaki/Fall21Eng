/*
    1)"Encapsulation" means "data-hiding"
    
    2)To encapsulate, we use "private" keyword. 
    
    3)By the help of " encapsulation" you will be able to do many tasks by using just single object. 
    i)Create an object i) by using setters update the values  which you need then work with newly updated object
