	 	1) throws, throw, try, catch, finally, compile time exception(checked), runtime exception(unchecked)
	 	
	 	2) Differences between "throw" and "throws"
	 	   i)"throw" is used in "method body" but "throws" is used in method name line
	 	   ii)After "throw" keyword we create an object by using Exception classes but after "throws" keyword
	 	      we type just the name of Exceptionn class
	 	   iii)After "throws" keyword you can use multiple Exception class names by separating the by comma
	 	       but after "throw" keyword you can create just a single object
	 	       Note: After "throws" keyword parent and child Exception classes cannot be used together, Java removes
	 	             child and replace parent automatically
	 	   iv) "throws" can be used once at most in a method but "throw" can be used many times in a method body.
